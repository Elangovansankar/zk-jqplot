ZK jqPlot Component
=========

Current Version : 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to integrate the popular javascript chartting library [jqPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/) into [ZK Framework](http://www.zkoss.org/)

This add-on is currently under construction, but it already supports some basic features of chart plotting. 
You can download the source code here or just download the jar file [here](https://github.com/kurorido/zk-jqplot/blob/master/dist/jqplot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) to try some examples.
